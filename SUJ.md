# Introduction

Acronyms used in this page are defined in [Frequently Asked Questions](/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/FAQ).

This page describes how to use the Setup Joints (SUJs) with the dVRK.  This is useful only for the groups with a [full da Vinci](/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/Full-da-Vinci.md)

# Setup joints

## Physical dimension

Joints diameters:
* 0: Translation, where's the origin?
* 1: Rotation, vertical axis, diameter 147.5 mm, circumference 463.4 mm (all -90/+90)  
* 2: Rotation, vertical axis, diameter 133.5 mm, circumference 419.4 mm (PSM1 -135/0, PSM2 0/+135, PSM3/ECM -90/+90) 
* 3: Rotation, vertical axis, diameter 107.5 mm, circumference 337.7 mm (all -90/+90)
* 4: Rotation, horizontal axis, diameter 93.3 mm, circumference 293.1 mm (PSMs only -135/+135)
* 5: Rotation, "vertical" axis, diameter 89.4 mm, circumference 280.9 mm (PSMs only -135/+135)

## Labels

You can download a document to print on letter paper: [dVRK labels for SUJ](/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/suj-labels.svg).  The `.svg` file can be opened, modified and printed using `inkscape` on Linux.  You can also find a [pdf version](/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/suj-labels.pdf) if you don't have `inkscape`.  Please, if you update the `.svg` file, make sure you also update the `.pdf`.
