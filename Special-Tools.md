# Introduction

Some tools are supported by the dVRK but need to be physically modified

## Permanent Cautery Spatula (xxx184)

We need to "disable" disk #4 on the tool because the actuator 3 and 4 are mechanically coupled inside the tool.  At that point (December 2019), the dVRK software doesn't support driving 2 actuators coupled together to control a single joint.   Since it is hard to remove the mechanical coupling inside the tool, we recommend to disable the disk #4 (either by removing the disk or filling off the plots on the disk).
