# Compatible development branches

Starting with version 2.0, you should use the `.rosintall` file in the *dvrk-ros* repository to pull all the dependencies required for the `master` or `devel` branches. 

# Changes

## Roadmap for 2.1

* Small projects
  * Update Teleop doc
  * #121, add cap on maximum difference between PID goals
  * IK with joint limits for PSMs
  * #54, save content of `.cal` file in generated XML file (for debug, retrieval, ...)
  * Add alert when SUJ are moved without brakes released
  * Autonomous ECM motion
  * Documentation and scripts for stereo camera calibration

* Bigger projects
  * Trajectory in cartesian space
  * Controller class:
    * Separate control PSM from PSM jaws
    * Add different controllers: velocity, interpolate...
  * 3D User Interface, ideally with RViz + endoscopic stereo stream
  * Better teleop PSM:
    * Use symmetry of MTM to set orientation and optimize roll
    * Force feedback on MTM based on error in orientation between MTM and PSM
  * MoveIt! (via CRTK)
  * Binary packages with repository on dvrk.lcsr.jhu.edu
  * ROS 2 (would likely require binary packages)
